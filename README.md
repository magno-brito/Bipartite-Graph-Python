## Bipartite Graph

<em> [In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U and V, that is, every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V. Vertex sets U and V are usually called the parts of the graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph). </em>

## The Problem

<em>If there are J jobs and A applicants and each applicant can do some jobs, how can we to asign these jobs to the applicats so that the maximum applicants get the 
job?</em>
